## ANOVA

ANOVA stands for Analysis of variance, and it allows you to compare more than two groups at the same time to determine if any relationship between them exists.


## Simple hypothesis test:

- H0 – All sample means are equal or they don’t differ significantly.
- H1 – At least one of the sample means is different from the rest.

## Hypothesis testing using 1 way ANOVA

- Generate synthetic dataset
- Find variance between different groups
- Find variance within different groups
- Find f statistic
- Find p-value
